Desc:
We wrote an interactive video game called Bouncers.  The goal of the game
is to keep clicking the balls, preventing them from touching the fire.

How to compile and run:
jrgo [pc1 | pc2 | ... | pcN | localhost]*

Examples:
Single Player (Single Virtual Machine):
jrgo			// defaults to localhost
OR
jrgo pc1	// explicitly state the machine to start up on

Multiple Players (Multiple Virtual Machines):
jrgo localhost pc3 pc4	// start up three VMs.  "localhost" will be the host
												// board, all other arguments will be clients
